Title: About

I'm a full stack web developer currently heading up the development team at [www.trustedhousesitters.com](http://www.trustedhousesitters.com/) down in sunny Brighton in the UK.

I spent a large part of my career in the black hole that is enterprise software, so trying to change my ways and open up. It's good to share.
