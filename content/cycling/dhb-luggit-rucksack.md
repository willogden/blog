Summary: Superb budget rucksack that will take a Mac Book Pro 15"

With a change in commute to a foldup bike plus train, I was in the market for a rucksack that was both water
resistant and could safely house my Mac Book Pro 15". Finding something affordable was actually fairly hard ork.
After a number of hours scouring the interweb I came accross the DHB Luggit 30L.

At Â£24 this is a bargain. Waist straps are detachable, and it's got a neat unfolding waterproof cover if it's
really pouring - though I've been caught in the rain a couple of times without this on, and the inside has
remained completely dry.
